1.  list:can be seen as a collection of elements without any restriction on the class, length or structure of each     element. The only thing you need to take care of, is that you don't give two elements the same name. 

2.  Dataframes: are lists as well, but they have a few restrictions:
  1.you can't use the same name for two different variables
  2.all elements of a data frame are vectors
  3.all elements of a data frame have an equal length.

 Question 2  :Explore datasets "sleep" and "phones".Which dataset is a list?
    str(sleep):data.frame    str(phones):List
    
 Question 3  :Which column within "sleep" data is an ordered factor?
    str(sleep):no!

 Question 4  :Extract the rows of group 1 in "sleep".
    sleep[sleep$group==1,]

#    extra group ID
#1    0.7     1  1
#2   -1.6     1  2
#3   -0.2     1  3
#4   -1.2     1  4
#5   -0.1     1  5
#6    3.4     1  6
#7    3.7     1  7
#8    0.8     1  8
#9    0.0     1  9
#10   2.0     1 10
    
 Question 5  :Extract the rows that have negative values in extra column.
    sleep[sleep$extra < 0,]

#    extra group ID
# 2   -1.6     1  2
# 3   -0.2     1  3
# 4   -1.2     1  4
# 5   -0.1     1  5
# 15  -0.1     2  5

 Question 6  :Explore dataset "phones", and extract the first 6 elements in variable year.
   head(phones$year,n=6)
 #[1] 50 51 52 53 54 55
 
 Question 7  :Create a new list All, which contains both the datasets "sleep" and "phones".
 ALL<-list(sleep=sleep,phones=phones)
 
 Exercise:
 movies <- c('Titanic', 'Minions')
 like <- c(rep('bad',5), rep('good',2), rep('good', 100))
 comments <- c('hate!', 'awful~', 'AWFUL!!','not recommended','the music is not good', 'love the actors',rep('soooooocute!!!!', 20))
 
 reviews <- list(movies=movies, like=like, comments=comments)
 length(reviews[[3]])
 
 
 review_data <- data.frame(
  movies=c(rep('Titanic',7),rep('Minions',100)),like=like,comments = c(head(comments), rep('None',81), tail(comments,20)))

review_data[review_data$like=='good',]
